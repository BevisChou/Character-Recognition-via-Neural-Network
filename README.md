## Background

Among all the machine learning algorithms, neural network learning is one of the most popular. After learning the basics of neural network learning on Coursera, I decided to apply the knowledge to the task of hand-written digit recognition.

## Usage

### Initialization

Please unzip the RAR file to the directory. Note that you should not rename the folder as well as the folders inside. Before running the codes please add the folder as well as all the files inside to path.

### Getting Started

At the Octave/MATLAB command line, type *main* to run the codes.

### Explore

In the process you would be asked to type in a few parameters. You could try out different sets of parameters to see how the results differ. In later parts of the process, the effects of the parameters would be shown in multiple graphs.

You could also add your own hand-written digits to corresponding folders. Please note that the number of images of each digit should be approximately the same, and you're encouraged to add as many images as possible.

### Warning

Please do not press *enter* until you're asked to, or errors might occur because of missing parameters.

## Disclaimer

Due to the unsatisfactory performance of *fminunc* in Optimization Toolbox, another optimization function *fmincg*, provided by Stanford University in Machine Learning course on Coursera, is used in the process. To use it in your own work, please do check your eligibility first.
